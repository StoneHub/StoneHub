# Hey, I’m Monroe Stone 👋

I’m a software engineer with experience across **Android**, **cloud platforms**, and **automation-heavy workflows**. I build practical tools that solve real problems—whether that’s mobile product work, backend systems, or AI-assisted development pipelines that speed up delivery.

I’m also the owner of **FlyingChanges Farm**, where I apply the same engineering mindset to real-world operations: reliability, automation, and making systems work under everyday constraints.

## What I work on

- 📱 **Mobile Engineering** (Android / WearOS, MVVM, Kotlin)
- ☁️ **Cloud + Backend** (Azure, GCP, APIs, automation services)
- ⚙️ **DevOps-minded workflows** (Linux, Docker, CI/CD, system reliability)
- 🤖 **AI-assisted development** (rapid prototyping, debugging, iteration loops)

## Current focus

- Building and refining production-ready automation workflows
- Shipping mobile-first tools with strong reliability and UX
- Combining software engineering with practical operational problem-solving

## Background

My path includes enterprise engineering roles, cloud development, automation/RPA work, and hands-on systems support. I care a lot about useful software, clear execution, and getting things to actually run in the real world.
